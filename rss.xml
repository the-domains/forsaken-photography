            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Get in touch!</h1><p>Welcome to the new home of FORSAKEN.photography! My passion is photographing unusual and abandoned places. I especially love photographing people in those places. If you want portraits or headshots that are edgy, rugged or just more interesting than what everyone else is doing, you've come to the right place! My home base is Fairfield County, CT, but I'll go anywhere to do a kickass portrait in a kickass place!</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Holy Land USA - Waterbury CT</h1><p>Since we are right in the middle of Holy Week, I decided it would be a good time to take a ride up to Holy Land USA in Waterbury, CT. The last time (and first time) I came here was over 10 years ago, and it was already in a terrible state of disrepair. I'll have to dig up the few pictures I took from that trip (just prints from a film point and shoot lol). It definitely looks much worse now than I remember it being then. I have some vague memories of headless camels that were completely absent this time. Overall though it is a miracle that it's even still here at all 10+ years is a whole lot of time for vandals and the weather to do their worst. To me it was fascinating, as a photographer and lover of all things abandoned, and also sad that nothing could be done to save this quirky little place that seemed to be so lovingly made as a fun tribute to God. There is a bright side though. A few years ago a brand new cross was erected on the peak (with the help of my friend Dave and his Industrial Riggers) so at least a part of Holy Land shines brightly every night in all different colors depending on the season â™¥</p></article>]]></description>
