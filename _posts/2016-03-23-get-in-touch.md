Welcome to the new home of FORSAKEN.photography! My passion is photographing people in unusual and abandoned places. If you want portraits,  headshots or even photos to highlight your product or service that are edgy, rugged or just more interesting than what everyone else is doing, you've come to the right place! My home base is Fairfield County, CT, but I'll go anywhere to do a kickass portrait in a kickass place!
